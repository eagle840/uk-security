Hx of Frameworks (wrt UK)
Looks like IISP framework came out 1st (UK)
Others inc: ISC2  ISACA

#### UK 
Cyber Essentials  
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps-to-cyber-security/the-10-steps   

#### NCSC  
It appears that NCSC has a Certified Professional scheme called CCP?  
https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/about-certified-professional-scheme  
(below pulled from  CCP-Certification_for_Cyber_Security_IA_Professionals_5-4%20(3).pdf)  
" Certified Professional scheme sets the standard for UK cyber security professionals"  
! two blog posts in there - read them and date  

Certification Bodies (CBs) approved by the NCSC  (allowing work on UK government networks and Critical National Infrastructure (CNI))
- APM Group
- BCS (the Chartered Institute for IT)
- CIISec, CREST and RHUL consortium

Looks like the system is broken up unto roles, and you work your way up in skill  level in each role (practitioner, senior, lead).  
Each particular level has been assigned a SFIA responsibility level (see below)  
Looks like it's based on a framework: IISP Skills Framework version 2.3 (sections A-k) see below
ROLES: 
	* IA Accreditor, partitioner is SFIA level 3
	* Security and Information Risk Advisor (SIRA) partitioner is SFIA level 2
	* IA Architect (cyber security) partitioner is SFIA level 2
	* IA Auditor (cyber security) partitioner is SFIA level 2.
	* IT Security Officer (family of roles: Information System Security Officer (ISSO)L2, Information System Security Manager (ISSM), IT Security Officer(ITSO)  )
	* Communications Security Officer (family of roles: Comsec Practitioner (L2), Comsec Manager, ComSO)
