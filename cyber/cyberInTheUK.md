# UK cyber security in the UK

I'm getting ready to take 2 or three security exams, Sec+ Azure Security, and another - yet to be deteremined.

So the Sec+ cover alot great security knowledge, but alot of the laws and regulations are based around the US market.
Having spent a good 30 years is the US, and running my own IT company there, many of the over welhing content would have applied to me,
However I now live in the UK, with the law's being more alligned with the EEC than with the US. 

While looking for a certification in security - one of the important requirements was to make sure that I pick a cert was was the most recognized in the UK. Being  aware of  U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 8570.1 - I just needed to find a version for the UK.


At first I came accross the CCP from NCSC - the UK's top org for cyber-security.
However digging through the documents I would find they were out of data and out-of-date info.
CCP orginally from the CESG (link)
The clearest description of CCP I found was at bcs (https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/certifications-for-professionals/information-security-and-ccp-scheme-certifications/ncsc-certified-cyber-professional-ccp-scheme/)

NCSC does appear to certiify training courses, which in it's self doesn't provide an nation recognized standard/certification. (https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/certified-training)
And futher digging, there appears to be no nation basic/entry certification for IT professions.

CIISEC appears to have them own ICSF exam, but is based own on their own (and property) framework which can only be accessed with ££
(https://www.ciisec.org/CIISEC/Development/ICSF_Exam.aspx) and so have no idea of the content.

One thing I did find, is everyone what's their own framework. 



Of note was that the CISSP has been officially recognized as equivalent to a Master’s Degree across Europe (https://www.qa.com/course-catalogue/courses/cissp-certified-information-systems-security-professional-cissp/    AND https://blog.isc2.org/isc2_blog/2020/05/cissp-comparable-to-uk-masters-degree-standard.html)

Thinks i think that a basic nation currlium should inc.

ISO2700x and others
NHS DSP toolkit
