FROM PARAGRAPH 2

The 'framework' contributes to Objective 4 of the UK Cyber security
Strategy (reference [a]),   (a= http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/cyber-security-strategy)< which is a 2015 document.
Objective 4: (in Annex A) 'Building the UKâ€™s cross-cutting knowledge, skills and capability to underpin all cyber security objectives'
    which inc 3 approachs: Extending knowledge, Enhancing skills, and Expanding capability
    and 'Actions to include) , many of which are dated 2012

It should point to https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-cyber-security-strategy-2016-to-2021

At this point it doesn't appear to be referencing at particlar framework, or location/document

FROM PARAGRAP 3
document is complemented by 'Guidance to NCSC Certification for Cyber Security/IA Professionals' => no direct link

FROM 'Executive Summary'

"The purpose of certification is to enable better matching between requirements for
cyber security/IA professionals and the competencies of the staff or contractors undertaking common
cyber security/IA responsibilities. Its primary purpose is to provide employers with an assured pool of
certified cyber security/IA professionals for recruitment."

This framework:
'The framework includes a set of cyber security/IA role definitions and
a certification process.'

	ROLE DEFINITIONS:
		(pull these from the document)
		Appears to pull its skill definitions from several source, inc SFIA and iisp
		- SFIA - a web site that has a bad cert, but it should really point to https://www.sfia-online.org/en
		- iisp  (has not been updated to correct domain, ciisex) (NCSC-CCP appears to be using the older v1 skills framework from iisp, however (now) ciisec skills framework is upto v2 (and appears to be confidential)
